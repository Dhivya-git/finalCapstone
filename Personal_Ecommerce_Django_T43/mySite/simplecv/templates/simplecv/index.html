        <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight: bold;">Dhivyalakshmi Subramanian</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px">I am an aspiring Software Engineer keen to get back into IT. I am a creative individual who finds 
            developing software solutions immensely rewarding. I have been intrigued by technologies for as long
            as I could remember and have always wanted to help create robust software systems using cutting edge 
            technologies that help progress mankind. Helping with the advancement of humanity through technology,
            is something I am passionate about, which I think I can achieve being a software engineer.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:20px">I have a Bachelor Of Engineering degree in Information Technology with a history of working for Cisco 
            Offshore Development Centre, world leader in providing network solutions. I was recognised with SPARC 
            award from HCL Technologies for achieving high level of customer satisfaction which shows my positive 
            work ethics.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:20px">The process of contributing to develop a software, then watching it flourish, I believe, is extremely
            rewarding. The best part of having a software engineering career for me seems to be the problem-solving 
            aspect - I will face numerous challenges, but I will try to solve them utilising the knowledge and skills 
            I have acquired previously and with the ones I am constantly learning, combined with my creativity and 
            imagination. I am always eager to learn new technologies and to utilize my knowledge to my highest 
            ability. Eventually, I want to feel proud and satisfied on my performance wherever I work.
