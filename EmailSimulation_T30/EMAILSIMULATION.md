# Email Simulation
Using OOP, this script in Python simulates the email client (inbox preloaded with few emails) by giving the user the option to compose email and send it to a sent box, to get the list of unread mails and read them, to mark the email as spam or delete them, to check for new emails which works by populating the inbox with a random fake email each time the user checks for new emails.
